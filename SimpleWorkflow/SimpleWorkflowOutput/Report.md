## API Information
- Title: Attachment Service API
- Description: The Attachment Service provides an API for managing file attachments with metadata, 
utilizing OAuth 2.0 security. It enables users to upload medical attachments as 
evidence for insurance procedures. 

Each submission undergoes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing to extract 
textual information, which is subsequently analyzed using AI technology. The AI system 
evaluates the information against established Care Guidelines to ensure compliance and 
support insurance claims verification. 

This streamlined process enhances the accuracy and efficiency of handling medical 
attachment uploads.
